What is the Strategy Design Pattern?
The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables an object to change its behavior at runtime without modifying its structure. It involves three key components:

Strategy Interface: This defines a common interface for all supported algorithms.
Concrete Strategies: These are classes that implement the strategy interface and encapsulate specific algorithms.
Context: This is a class that uses a strategy object and delegates it executing the behavior.
Why Use the Strategy Design Pattern?
Flexibility and Scalability: In rate limiting system, different strategies (Token Bucket, Leaking Bucket, Fixed Window, Sliding Window) encapsulate various algorithms for rate limiting. This pattern allows you to add new limiting strategies without altering the existing client code or strategies.
Decoupling of Implementation: Clients interact with the context without needing to understand the complex underlying algorithmic logic. This decoupling simplifies client interactions and enhances maintainability.
Interchangeable Behaviors: Depending on the application's needs or runtime conditions, you can switch strategies dynamically, providing great flexibility in how rate limits are applied.

What is the Factory Design Pattern?
The Factory design pattern is a creational pattern used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This is done by creating a separate component (the factory) whose responsibility is to encapsulate the creation logic of objects.

Why Use the Factory Design Pattern?
Simplification of Object Creation: The Factory pattern centralizes the creation of objects, which simplifies code by removing the need for constructors scattered throughout the application.
Support for Configuration: The RateLimiterFactory can read configurations and instantiate appropriate limiters, making the system easy to configure and extend without modifying existing code.
Decoupling: Clients of a factory only need to know about the abstract type (interface or abstract class) they work with, not the concrete implementations. This reduces dependencies within the system and makes it easier to modify, extend, or replace components.

How These Patterns Help Build Extendable Code
Extensibility: Both patterns allow the system to be extended with new behaviors (Strategy) or new object types (Factory) without modifying existing code. This extensibility is crucial for adapting to new requirements or changes in business logic.
Ease of Maintenance: By segregating the system into distinct patterns, each responsible for a specific aspect of functionality, the system becomes easier to understand, maintain, and test.
Reduction of Conditional Logic: By using polymorphism over conditional logic, the code becomes cleaner, easier to understand, and less prone to errors.

This approach significantly aids in future developments and maintenance efforts.
